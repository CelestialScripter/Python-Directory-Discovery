## Python-Directory-Discovery
**Project Overview**

In this project, we will create a powerful tool for web application directory discovery. The primary purpose of this tool is to perform directory and file name brute-forcing on web and application servers. This can be incredibly valuable for both security professionals and web administrators.

**Project Objectives**

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

  -Directory and File Enumeration: The tool will systematically scan a web server or web application to identify hidden directories and files. This process involves sending a series of HTTP requests with different directory and file names in an attempt to discover resources that might not be readily accessible through typical navigation.

  -Security Testing: Security professionals can use this tool to perform security assessments and penetration testing on web applications. By identifying hidden or sensitive directories and files, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations can be uncovered before malicious actors have a chance to exploit them.

  -Web Administration: Web administrators can utilize this tool for maintenance and security purposes. It allows them to identify orphaned or forgotten directories and files, helping them maintain a cleaner and more secure web server environment.
