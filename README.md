## Python-Directory-Discovery
**Project Overview**

In this project, we will create a powerful tool for web application directory discovery. The primary purpose of this tool is to perform directory and file name brute-forcing on web and application servers. This can be incredibly valuable for both security professionals and web administrators.

**Project Objectives**

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Directory and File Enumeration: The tool will systematically scan a web server or web application to identify hidden directories and files. This process involves sending a series of HTTP requests with different directory and file names in an attempt to discover resources that might not be readily accessible through typical navigation.

- Security Testing: Security professionals can use this tool to perform security assessments and penetration testing on web applications. By identifying hidden or sensitive directories and files, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations can be uncovered before malicious actors have a chance to exploit them.

- Web Administration: Web administrators can utilize this tool for maintenance and security purposes. It allows them to identify orphaned or forgotten directories and files, helping them maintain a cleaner and more secure web server environment.

## Installation
Refer to requirements.txt file to know the dependencies.

## Usage
``` Python3 directories.py ```

It will create a prompt 

``` [*] Enter Target URL: {url or IP ADDR} ```

``` [*] Enter Name of The File Containing Directories : list.txt ```

## Liability Disclaimer

**Usage Agreement:** The code contained in this repository should only be used with proper consent and in strict compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws. Users of this code are solely responsible for ensuring their activities adhere to legal regulations and obligations.

**No Liability:** The developers of this code assume no liability and shall not be held responsible for any misuse, damage, or harm resulting from the use of this code by unauthorized individuals or malicious actors, whether intentional or accidental. This includes any actions that compromise the security, privacy, integrity, or availability of computer systems and associated resources. In this context, "compromise" refers to the exploitation of known or unknown vulnerabilities within these systems, which may involve circumventing security measures, whether through human actions or electronic means.

**Endorsement for Specific Scenarios:** The use of this code is explicitly endorsed by the developers in particular contexts, such as educational environments and authorized penetration testing engagements. These engagements should have a clearly defined objective: the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities in systems, with the goal of enhancing their resistance to exploitation and attacks by malicious actors. These objectives should align with the defined threat models relevant to the specific scenario.
